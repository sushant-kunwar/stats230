## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
States <- read.csv("/Users/sushantkunwar/Downloads/archive (1)/states_all_extended.csv")
View(States)


```

## Data Cleaning
```{r}
#making the row numbers the state name
rownames(States) <- States$STATE

#Removing the PRIMARY_KEY and STATE columns as it'll be redundant/confusing later
States <- States[ ,-1]
States <- States[ ,-1]
View(States)

#Creating a data frame for data from just 1992
States1992 <- States[c(1:51), ]
View(States1992)

#Creating a data frame for data from just 2016
States2015 <- States[c(1174:1224), ]
View(States2015)

#making the row numbers the state name
rownames(States) <- States$STATE

#Removing Columns with all NAs
States1992 <- States1992[,colSums(is.na(States1992)) < nrow(States1992)]
View(States1992)

States1992 <- States1992[,colSums(is.na(States1992)) < nrow(States1992)]
View(States1992)

## section choosing higher value for GRADES_ALL and ENROLL 



```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Sections of the Report
• Introduction (Background, motivation) – not more than a short paragraph.

In this project, we aim to analyze a comprehensive dataset that encapsulates various dimensions of U.S. education data, consolidating financial, demographic, and academic performance indicators at the state level into a single accessible format. The dataset, drawn from multiple authoritative sources, includes detailed breakdowns by race, gender, and grade level, alongside revenue and expenditure figures. By focusing on data from the years 1992 and 2015, we intend to explore changes and trends over time, providing insights into the evolution of educational environments across the states. This analysis not only seeks to uncover underlying patterns in educational achievement and funding but also to highlight areas of progress and ongoing challenges within the U.S. educational system.

• DATA: Make a LIST of all variables you actually use – describe units, anything I should
know. Ignore variables you don’t discuss.
YEAR
STATE
GRADES_ALL: the NCES's estimate for students in the state
ENROLL: The U.S. Census Bureau's count for students in the state. Should be comparable to GRADES_ALL
A_A_A (same as GRADES_ALL): Should be same data as above
TOTAL REVENUE: The total amount of revenue for the state.
TOTAL_EXPENDITURE: The total expenditure for the state.
INSTRUCTION_EXPENDITURE: Expenditure going toward instruction
*PROP_INSTR_EXP: proportion instruction expenditure CREATE THIS ONE (JUST INSTRUCTION/TOTAL)*
G08_A_A_MATHEMATICS: Average math score of eighth grade students
G08_A_M_MATHEMATICS: Average math score of eighth grade students that are classified as "male"
G08_A_F_MATHEMATICS: Average math score of eighth grade students that are classified as "female"
*G08_MATH_MFDiff: CREATE THIS ONE (just G08_A_M_MATHEMATICS - G08_A_F_MATHEMATICS)*
*Scores_to_InstrExpenditure: CREATE THIS ONE, relates expenditure on instruction to test scores*





• Data cleaning process – describe the cleaning process you used on your data. Talk
about what issues you encountered. It’s ok if your data was already relatively clean.

**Cleaning Plan**
Update our working dataframes to be just the columns we will use in our tests

• Descriptive Plots, summary information. Plots should be clearly labeled, well formatted,
and display an aesthetic sense.

• Analysis – see below
*can analyze that theres a bigger gap in 8th grade test scores among men and women*

• Conclusions and Summary – a short paragraph.
