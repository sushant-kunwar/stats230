## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
States <- read.csv("/Users/sushantkunwar/Downloads/archive (1)/states_all_extended.csv")
View(States)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Sections of the Report
• Introduction (Background, motivation) – not more than a short paragraph.

• DATA: Make a LIST of all variables you actually use – describe units, anything I should
know. Ignore variables you don’t discuss.

• Data cleaning process – describe the cleaning process you used on your data. Talk
about what issues you encountered. It’s ok if your data was already relatively clean.

• Descriptive Plots, summary information. Plots should be clearly labeled, well formatted,
and display an aesthetic sense.

• Analysis – see below

• Conclusions and Summary – a short paragraph.
